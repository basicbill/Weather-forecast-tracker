🎉 MULTI-LEAD-TIME UPGRADE

═════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT CHANGED
═════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Now tracks FOUR forecast lead times instead of one:
   • 1-day ahead (tomorrow's forecast)
   • 3-day ahead
   • 7-day ahead
   • 15-day ahead

✅ Shows accuracy degradation curve
   • See how accuracy drops as you forecast further out
   • Compare short-term vs long-term forecast reliability

✅ Updated dashboard displays:
   • Accuracy by lead time cards at the top
   • Each recent score shows which lead time it represents
   • Better data visualization

═════════════════════════════════════════
NEW TIMELINE
═════════════════════════════════════════

OLD: Wait 15 days for first result
NEW: See results starting TOMORROW!

• Tomorrow (Day 1): First 1-day forecast scored ✨
• Day 3: First 3-day forecast scored
• Day 7: First 7-day forecast scored  
• Day 15: First 15-day forecast scored

Full accuracy curve visible after just 15 days!

WHAT TO DO
═════════════════════════════════════════

1. Download the new zip file: weather-forecast-tracker-v2.zip

2. If you already set up the repo:
   - Delete the old files from your GitHub repo
   - Upload all the new files
   - Commit and push
   - The next run will use the new multi-lead-time system

3. If you haven't set up yet:
   - Just follow SETUP.txt as normal
   - You'll get the full multi-lead-time version

4. Delete that manual test forecast file (if you want):
   - The one from today in data/forecasts/
   - Tomorrow's scheduled run will create proper multi-lead-time files
   - Files will now be named like: 2024-10-23_lead1.json, 2024-10-23_lead3.json, etc.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
═════════════════════════════════════════

Files Modified:
✓ weather_tracker.py - Complete rewrite to handle multiple lead times
✓ index.html - Dashboard now shows accuracy by lead time
✓ README.md - Updated documentation
✓ SETUP.txt - Updated timeline and info

Data Structure:
• OLD: One file per day (2024-10-23.json)
• NEW: Four files per day (2024-10-23_lead1.json, _lead3.json, _lead7.json, _lead15.json)

Backward Compatible:
• Old results still display correctly
• New system recognizes old data format

═════════════════════════════════════════
EXPECTED RESULTS
═════════════════════════════════════════

You should see an accuracy pattern like this:

1-day forecast:   ~85-95% accurate
3-day forecast:   ~75-85% accurate
7-day forecast:   ~60-75% accurate
15-day forecast:  ~45-60% accurate

This varies by location:
• Stable climates (Phoenix): Better long-range accuracy
• Variable climates (Bismarck): Worse long-range accuracy

═════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTIONS?
═════════════════════════════════════════

The system still runs automatically at 8 AM UTC daily.
No changes to GitHub Actions or Netlify needed.
Just replace the files and you're good to go!

Results start appearing TOMORROW instead of in 15 days. 🎉
